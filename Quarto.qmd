## Introduction

In a world where connectivity shapes opportunity, owning a mobile phone is no longer a luxury-it is a lifeline. Yet, millions remain disconnected, locked out of essential services, education, healthcare, and economic possibilities. This report explores the global landscape of mobile telephone ownership, revealing striking inequalities across countries, genders, and generations. Through the lens of data, we witness not just numbers, but the quiet stories of progress and the urgent gaps that demand action. Because in today's world, to be unreachable is to be left behind.

```{python}
#| label: setup
#| include: false
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
import plotly.graph_objects as go
from plotly.subplots import make_subplots
import pycountry

# Load the data
df = pd.read_csv('unicef2 (1).csv')
custom_colors = ['#FF96A3', '#FFAA96', '#FF7555', '#FFB855', '#FFAFCD', '#FF96A3', '#FFAA96', '#FF7555']

# Clean and prepare data
df['time_period'] = pd.to_numeric(df['time_period'], errors='coerce')
latest_data = df.sort_values('time_period').groupby(['country', 'sex']).last().reset_index()
country_totals = latest_data[latest_data['sex'] == 'Total']
```

## Throught the Lens of DATA
Numbers alone rarely move us, but when translated into visuals, they become powerful narratives of connection, inequality, and progress. In this section, we delve deeper into the patterns and stories hidden within the data. A world map will reveal the stark contrasts between countries, highlighting where mobile ownership thrives and where it lags behind. A timeline will trace humanity’s growing bond with technology, showing both rapid advancements and areas of stagnation. We will also explore gender disparities, where access is not just about geography but also about deeply rooted societal divides. Finally, we will follow the trends across nations, observing how some are sprinting toward full connectivity while others are left behind.
Through these visualizations, we witness more than statistics — we see lives, opportunities, and the profound impact that a simple device can have in bridging the world together.

# Get countries with both male and female data
gender_df = latest_data[latest_data['sex'].isin(['Male', 'Female'])]
top_countries = gender_df['country'].value_counts().head(20).index
gender_comparison = gender_df[gender_df['country'].isin(top_countries)]

fig = px.bar(gender_comparison,
             x="country",
             y="obs_value",
             color="sex",
